Simply uses docusaurus to build https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/docs with @easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local for search

(official docs still don't have search https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/9846)

TODO:
- https://lukaw3d.github.io/react-router-v6-searchable-docs/search?q=loadinvoice search doesn't find `loadInvoice` in `loader={loadInvoice}`: https://lukaw3d.github.io/react-router-v6-searchable-docs/route/error-element
